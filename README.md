## 📖 Overview

**JunkPOinT** is a console-based Java application designed as a *Recyclable Trash Redemption System*. It encourages recycling practices by allowing users to receive rewards for collecting waste materials such as plastic, metal, glass, paper, and electronics.

Users record their waste collections to earn points based on material type and quantity. These points can be:
* Redeemed for food items.
* Converted into cash.
* Donated (showing the weight of carbon dioxide emissions saved).

This system works directly through the terminal, demonstrating the practical use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts alongside proper file handling and modular design. It supports the **United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals**:
* **Goal 12:** Responsible Consumption and Production
* **Goal 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities

## 🧩 OOP Concepts Applied

### 🔒 Encapsulation
In the JunkPOint system, encapsulation is shown by keeping user-related information such as passwords, usernames, accumulated points, and transaction records private. Instead of allowing other parts of the program to directly change these values, the system uses controlled methods like getters, setters, and updating functions. This protects user data and ensures that important values, such as points or passwords, cannot be altered accidentally or improperly.

### 🧬 Inheritance
Inheritance appears in the system through the relationship between user types. For example, the `Guest` class can extend a base user-type structure, allowing it to inherit common features such as viewing menu options, accessing recycling information, and participating in basic system functions like donating waste. The Guest class automatically gains essential behaviours from the parent class but can still impose restrictions such as not being able to redeem items or convert points.

### 🎭 Polymorphism
The system utilises polymorphism to allow methods to behave differently based on the object calling them. The `displayMenu()` method is defined in the abstract `Person` class but is implemented differently in the `User` and `Guest` subclasses. This ensures that while both are treated as "Persons," a registered User sees the full dashboard while a Guest sees only donation options. Additionally, the `Voucher` class overrides the `toString()` method to provide a custom formatted display of the voucher details when printed.

### 🧱 Abstraction
Abstraction is demonstrated in the system by hiding complex processes inside simple and easy-to-use methods. Methods like `calculatePoints()` or `convertPointsToCash()` do all the detailed work. This hides the formulas and lets the main programming simply call it. The main program just calls these methods and shows the results. This makes the code easier to read and maintain. It helps focus on what the program does rather than how it works internally.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`JunkPoint.java`** | **Main Entry Point.** The core simulation managing the console UI, navigation, menus, and transaction flows. |
| **`User.java`** | Manages registered user data, point balance, voucher storage, and rewards logic. |
| **`Guest.java`** | Handles guest functionalities, specifically waste donation and CO2 calculation without account storage. |
| **`Person.java`** | **Abstract Base Class.** Enforces the structure (e.g., `name`, `displayMenu()`) for all user types. |
| **`Voucher.java`** | Data structure for redeemed items, generating unique `voucherCode` and details. |
| **`WasteCalculator.java`** | Utility class using a `HashMap` to store point values and calculate totals based on waste type/quantity. |
| **`Redeemable.java`** | **Interface.** Defines the contract for redeeming items and converting points to cash. |
| **`InsufficientPointsException.java`** | **Custom Exception.** Handles errors when a user attempts to spend more points than available. |

(2) Why is recycling important?


        Recycling plays a major role in protecting the environment and conserving resources. Here are the key
reasons why recycling is essential:
1. Reduces Waste in Landfills:
        Recycling helps decrease the amount of trash that ends up in landfills, preventing overflow and
        pollution.
2. Saves Natural Resources:
        Materials like plastic, metal, paper, glass, and electronics can be recycled and reused, reducing
        the need to extract new raw materials from nature.
3. Lowers Energy Consumption:
        Producing items from recycled materials often uses far less energy than manufacturing new ones.
4. Prevents Pollution:
        Recycling reduces harmful emissions, protects ecosystems, and helps keep air, water, and soil clean.
5. Supports Sustainability:
        It promotes responsible resource use, ensuring a healthier and greener environment for future genera-
        tions, and supports SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption
        and Production) by the United Nations.
6. Encourages Community Involvement:
        Systems like JunkPOinT inspire people to take part in environmental efforts while receiving rewards
        for their contributions.

Exiting JunkPOinT, the Recyclable Trash Redemption System... thank you for supporting SDG No. 11 and 12!


Always Remember: The environment is where we all meet, where we all have a mutual interest; it is the one thing
all of us share. It is not only a mirror of ourselves, but a focusing lens on what we can become.
                                                   - Speech at Yale University, White House Diary, Oct. 9, 1967


So, protect it, love it, and donate waste in every bit of it!
